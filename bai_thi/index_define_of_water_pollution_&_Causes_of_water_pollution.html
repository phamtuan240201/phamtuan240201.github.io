                            <h5>a) Concept of water pollution:</h5>
                                <p class="text_indent">
                                    Water pollution is the state of water invaded by toxic substances. 
                                    They are formed from activities of production and human activities.
                                </p>
                            <h5>b) Harm of water pollution:</h4>
                                <p class="text_indent">Harm to human health
                                    The common consequence of water pollution is the increasing proportion of people suffering from acute and chronic diseases related to water pollution such as conjunctivitis, diarrhea, cancer.
                                    People living in polluted areas are increasingly infected with many suspected diseases due to the use of dirty water in all activities.
                                    Moreover, water pollution also causes great losses for production and business sectors and aquaculture households.
                                    Scientific studies also show that when people use arsenic-contaminated water for eating and drinking, people can get cancer which is often skin cancer. 
                                    In addition, arsenic also poisoned the circulatory system when drinking water from arsenic content of 0.1 mg / l. 
                                    Therefore, it is necessary to treat arsenic-contaminated water before using for living and eating.
                                    People who have been infected with lead for a long time may develop kidney disease, neurological diseases, Ammonium, nitrate and nitrite infections, which cause blue skin disease, anemia and can cause cancer. Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) is a common additive in oil and carcinogenic potential. 
                                    Sodium (Na) infection causes high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and sulfur to cause gastrointestinal disease. Potassium, Cadimi cause spinal degeneration, back pain. Organic compounds, pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, growth stimulants, food preservatives, phosphorus ... cause poisoning, hepatitis, vomiting.
                                    Organic compounds, pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, growth stimulants, food preservatives, phosphorus ... cause poisoning, hepatitis, vomiting. Prolonged contact will cause serious cancer of the internal organs. Xenon peroxide, sodium percarbonate bleach causes inflammation of the airways. 
                                    Oxalate combines with calcium to create calcium oxalate that causes kidney pain, gallstones. Bacteria, parasites of all kinds are the cause of gastrointestinal diseases, worms and tapeworm infections. Heavy metals of all kinds: titanium, iron, lead, cadmium, arsenic, mercury, zinc cause neuralgia, kidney, excretory system, osteoarthritis, anemia.                                    
                                </p>
                            <h4>2. Causes of water pollution:</h4>
                            <h5>a) From agricultural production</h5>
                                <div class="causes">

                                </div>
                                <p class="text_indent"> Agricultural activities such as cattle breeding, cattle urine, uneaten leftovers and other agricultural production activities, pesticides, fertilizers from rice fields, melons, orchards, vegetables Contains toxic chemicals that can pollute groundwater and surface water.
                                    During agricultural production, the majority of farmers used pesticides three times the recommended dosage.
                                    Not only that, farmers also use the banned pesticides such as Thiodol, Monitor ... In the process of fertilizing, spraying, farmers do not equip labor protection devices.
                                    The widespread use of chemical fertilizers and plant protection chemicals in agriculture has also affected water resources. The amount of residual chemicals will seep into the aquifers and affect the amount of water.
                                    Most farmers do not have drug storage facilities. Unused medicines are stored everywhere, including near cafeterias and running water. Most of used pesticide bottles are thrown away on the banks of the field, the rest is collected for sale of scrap.
                                </p>
                            <h5>b) From industrial production</h5>
                                <p class="text_indent"> Due to the increasing pace of urbanization and industrialization leading to the establishment of industrial parks, the amount of waste and wastewater from industrial activities is increasing, and it has not been thoroughly treated for discharging directly into the environment or rivers.
                                    Water sources affect the current water quality, followed by a series of dead underwater creatures.

                            <h5>c) From the natural impact on the water environment</h5>
                            <p class="text_indent">Any phenomenon that reduces water quality is considered as a cause of water pollution. 
                                Water pollution is caused by rain, melting snow, floods ... or the living products of living things, not to mention their dead bodies. Plants and organisms die, they are decomposed by microorganisms into organic matter. Part of it will be absorbed into the ground, then it will be absorbed deep into the groundwater, causing pollution, or following the groundwater flow into the big stream.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text_indent">Prolonged flooding may cause more severe pollution due to chemicals used in agriculture, industrial waste, chemical pollution ... Water pollution due to natural factors (volcanoes, storms) floods, erosion ...) can be very serious. </p>
                            <p class="text_indent">The decrease in water quality may be due to the geological characteristics of the water source, for example, water on acid sulphate soils often contains a lot of iron, aluminum or groundwater that often contains a lot of calcium ...</p>
